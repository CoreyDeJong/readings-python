## Panda - Linear Regression
- Regression searches for relationships among variables.
- The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
- The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.
- The coefficient of determination, denoted as 𝑅², tells you which amount of variation in 𝑦 can be explained by the dependence on 𝐱 using the particular regression model
- Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in your data.
