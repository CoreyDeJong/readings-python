## Graphs
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the un
- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
- A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
- A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- an adjacency matrix will show the combinations of nodes that are connected. "1" if yes and "0" if not.
- an adjancy list will list each node and show a linked-list connection from each node
- a weighted graph is when the connections("edges") between each node have a different weighted value assigned to them
- you can create a weighted matrix that replaces the "1" and "0" with the actual weight values between the two nodes
