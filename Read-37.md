## ES6
- Template Literals: `let str = `Release Date: ${date}``
- Arrow Functions: `let func = (a) => {}`

## React
- React is a JavaScript library, is similar to Angular
- SX produces React “elements”.
- React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
- React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
- components are pieces of what the user sees, a full application is a collection of individual components (nav bar, profile,...
- React will create a virtual copy of the Real DOM
- when a component is updted on the react virtual dom, react will compare to the real dom and update as needed
