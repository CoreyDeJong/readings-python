## Cryptography
- cryptography means secret writing
- cipher is an algorithm that converst plain text, which is unlocked using a key. This process of locking infrormation is called encryption and unlocking is decryption
- defense in depth is adding multiple layers of defense given no one defense mechanism is perfect
- a cesar cipher is one of the most basic ciphers by simply changing the position of a character by a pre-determined number of places.
- simple subsititute cyphers can easily be cracked given letter like "e" are more common than other letters, and the subsituted letter will be identified more than other letters
