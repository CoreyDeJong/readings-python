## Whiteboarding
- communication is the most important, but talking and thinking is not possible, so take some time to think
- go through a feedback loop of discussing thoughts, getting feedback and revising your plan
- restate the question to ensure you understand it
- edge cases are to ensure you understand the problem, thinking of scenarios that may or may not be relevant
- edge cases are a way of showing that you know about testing and are experienced in the entire process of software development
- pseudo code should make the same sense in any language
- if you get stuck, it's ok to ask for a little help
- intervies are about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilitie
