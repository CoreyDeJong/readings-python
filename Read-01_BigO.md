## Pain vs. Suffering
 - Summarize in my own words: one of my favorite sayings is "there is no growth in a comfort zone and no comfort in a growth zone".

## Big O
 - Give we do not have experience with this topic yet at Codefellows, I don't have a lot to discuss on this topic yet. My only question right now is to understand the actual performance metrics of have different efficiency levels of your code. Given the exponential growth of computer speed and decreasing cost, I'm curious to how big of an issue this is right now and especially year after year.
 - O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
 - O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
 - O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
 - O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential
 - 'Binary search' is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it

## Names and Values in Python
 - Understanding now how names and values refer to each other was interesting and good to know given I would have assumed otherwise.
 - names only refer to values and vice versa, names do not refer to other names

## Awesome Python Environment
 - `Pyenv` will allow you to switch between different versions of python, it is an interpreter.
 - `Poetry` will help manage project dependencies, separate your projects through virtual environments and build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.
- `Black` is a tool for python that allows you to focus on what is necessary, the content. It does that by freeing you from manual code formatting through automation.
- `Pre-commit` is a tool that executes checks before you commit code to your repository
