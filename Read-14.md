## Trees
- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

- Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-pat

-Breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. Letâ€™s break down the process.

- Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

- The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n)

- A Binary Search Tree (BST) nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
