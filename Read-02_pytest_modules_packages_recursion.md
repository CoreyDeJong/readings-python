## Python Modules and Packages
 - Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.
 - A moduleâ€™s contents are accessed with the import statement.
 - It is also possible to import individual objects but enter them into the local symbol table with alternate names
 - This makes it possible to place names directly into the local symbol table but avoid conflicts with previously existing names


## Pytest Documentation
 - The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.


## PyTest Tutorial
 - pytest is mainly being used in industry to write tests for APIs.
 - Assertions are checks that return either True or False status
 - By default pytest only identifies the file names starting with test_ or ending with _test as the test files
 - Pytest requires the test method names to start with "test."
 - There will be some situations where we don't want to execute a test, or a test case is not relevant for a particular time. In those situations, we have the option to xfail the test or skip the test. The xfailed test will be executed, but it will not be counted as part failed or passed tests. There will be no traceback displayed if that test fails. We can xfail tests using


## Recursion
 - The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function
