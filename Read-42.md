## Nextjs Deployment
- The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform
- Vercel supports the DPS workflow: Develop, Preview, and Ship 
- Every page can either use Static Generation or Server-Side Rendering.
- Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Smart CDN, which is blazingly fast.
- Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
