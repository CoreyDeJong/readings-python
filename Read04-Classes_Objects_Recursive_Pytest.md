## Classes and Objects
- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
- You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class.
- To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable


## Thinking Recursively
- recursion is breaking one big thing into smaller little things
- Recursive functions have a recursive case that splits the big task into smaller tasks and the base case is the smallest task

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage
 - fixtures are when you want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem
 - coverage is a package that will create a report with every part of the python library that your program used
